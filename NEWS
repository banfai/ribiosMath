Version 1.0-3 (2013-02-27)
  + Removing package dependence on Rcpp: so far the package is placed under "LinkingTo" it runs fine.

Version 1.0-2 (2013-02-26)
  + Add function empval to calculate empirical p values from Monte Carlo methods
  + Add function randmat to generate a column-wise random matrix by sampling a numeric vector many times

Version 1.0-0 (2013-02-22)
  + New package ribiosMath for mathematic and statistical functions in ribios
  + Add function cossim for cosine similarity
  + Add function cosdist for cosine distance
